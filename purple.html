		<h1> anyway, hi</h1> 
		<p> i guess that video just about sums it up, but don't get the idea that i'm some unaccomplished loser or anything. i have received many awards and accolades throughout my life, and since i knew you wouldn't believe me i've compiled some of them <a href="achievements.html">here</a> for your viewing pleasure. and besides, what does it really matter anyway? people are always getting so worked up about <em>doing stuff</em> that they forget why they're even doing it in the first place. and quite frankly i don't think anyone even likes doing most of that stuff. think about the pure neurochemical reward of eating a donut, or the glorious relief of canceling plans that would've required you to wake up at 8 and pretend to be capable of forming coherent sentences at that time. you can't get that kind of beautiful joy from color coding every dang thing you own, and if you try to convince yourself otherwise you'll just end up empty and weeping into a bowl of quinoa.</p><br><br>
