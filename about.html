  	<p>Version A & version z represent the dual personalities within us all - an everyday Jekyll & Hyde with less intrigue and murder. Version A represents the motivated, disciplined achiever, while z is more fond of sedentary activity and not really worrying too much about anything. These two are present in all of us to various degrees, and their endless tug-of-war determines much of our expressed behavior.
      I wanted to acknowledge the presence of both of these ‘creatures’ and their roles in our internal selves by presenting a humorous take on the extremes they represent. the choice to draw them in photoshop, especially with my lack of any traditional art skills, was intended to increase the surreal, cartoonish vibe. I chose to represent them as featureless blobs because neither of them are independent entities alone, but together they quite nearly make a person.
